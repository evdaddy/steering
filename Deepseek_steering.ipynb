Let me think about what I learned in school.\\n\\nFirst off, I remember that to add two fractions, they need to have the same denominator. The denominator is the number on the bottom, right? So in this case, we have denominators 4 and 11. They aren't the same, which means I can't just add the numerators directly. Instead, I need to find a common denominator for both fractions.\\n\\nHow do you\", 'id': 'cmbmq2o3p006t5y3ioddp1odb', 'shareUrl': 'https://www.neuronpedia.org/steer/cmbmq2o3p006t5y3ioddp1odb', 'limit': '139'}\n",

Hmm, let me think about how to do this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I remember that when adding fractions, they need to have the same denominator. Right now, the denominators are 9 and 4. So, I need to find a common denominator for these two numbers. To find the least common denominator (LCD), I should probably find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 4.\\n\\nLet me list the multiples of 9: 9, 18, 27, 36, ', 'id': 'cmbmq307o006v5y3iim8mayjq', 'shareUrl': 'https://www.neuronpedia.org/steer/cmbmq307o006v5y3iim8mayjq', 'limit': '139'}\n",
